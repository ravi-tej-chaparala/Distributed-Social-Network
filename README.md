# Distributed-Social-Network

The project aims to design and implement a Distributed Social Media Platform that leverages distributed database concepts for scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient data management. This project is justified by the increasing demand for robust and scalable social media systems that can handle a large user base and ensure reliable performance.
